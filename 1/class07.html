                                    WHAT IS RPC?
 
        o The Open Network Computing Remote Procedure Call mechanism
          allows a server machine to define a procedure that a program
          on a client machine can call
 
            -- Originally used TCP and UDP
 
            -- SVR4 version uses any transport protocol
 
        o Each procedure takes one parameter and returns one result
 
            -- May be structures
 
        o By convention, all data passed into a remote procedure and
          returned by a procedure should be encoded into a common data
          representation (since different machines have different byte
          ordering, size, and word alignment)
 
        o The eXternal Data Representation package (XDR) provides
          routines that remote procedures can use to encode data into a
          common format

                        RPC DETAILS
 
        o When a server defines a procedure, it must supply a program
          number, version number, and procedure number for that
          procedure
 
            -- The program number defines a particular service grouping
 
            -- The version number allows RPC protocols to be extended
 
            -- The procedure number specifies the procedure within the
               service grouping
 
        o The server registers all procedures with the local portmapper
          daemon
 
        o By convention, every RPC takes one argument and returns one
          result
 
 
        o When a client application makes a remote procedure call, it
          specifies:
 
            -- server information
 
            -- program number
 
            -- version number
 
            -- procedure number
 
            -- argument to procedure
 
            -- result to be returned
 
            -- timeout information
 
        o Server performs the requested service
 
        o Results (or error information) returned to client
 
 
                                    GENERAL FLOW
 
          Server actions:
 
             o A program supplying the procedure is written
 
             o The program is run on the server machine
 
             o The program associates itself with an arbitrary, unused
               address
 
             o It tells the local portmapper daemon what the address is
 
                 -- The local portmapper is on a well-known address
 
 
          Client actions:
 
             o The client makes a request to the server's portmapper
 
                 -- The portmapper is on a well-known address
 
             o The client asks for the address of the program it wants
 
             o The portmapper sends the address to the client
 
             o The client communicates with the program
 
                 -- Calls procedures defined by the program
 
 
                                   AUTHENTICATION
 
          Every call and reply is authenticated.  Several flavors of
          authentication can be used:
 
             o ``none''
 
                 -- No information is passed
 
             o ``unix''
 
                 -- Machine name, user id, group id is passed
 
             o ``secure''
 
                 -- Uses cryptography for verification
 
             o Vendor-defined
 
 
                                   RPC PROGRAMMING
 
        o The remote procedure call mechanism uses several of low-level
          connection routines
 
        o These routines are generated automatically by a compiler,
          called rpcgen
 
            -- Uses the ``none'' flavor of authentication
            -- Can be changed explicitly
 
        o We will generate two RPC programs using rpcgen
 
        o Each RPC program needs three components:
 
            -- An RPC ``.x'' file
            -- The server side ``.c'' file
            -- The client side ``.c'' file

----------------------------------------------------------------------
The RPC definition language
 
The program definition:
 
       program identifier {
              version_list
       } = value;
 
The version_list:
 
       version identifier{
              procedure_list
       } = value;
 
The procedure_list:
 
       data_type procedure_name ( data_type ) = value;
 
example:
 
       program TIMEINFO {
            version TIMEVERS {
                   unsigned int GETTIME (void) = 1;
            } = 1;
       } = 0x20000009;
 
Produces a header file:
 
       #define TIMEINFO ((u_long)0x20000009)
       #define TIMEVERS ((u_long)1)
       #define GETTIME ((u_long)1)
       extern u_int *gettime_1();
 
---------------------------------------
Complex Data Types:
---------------------------------------
 
Constants
 
       const identifier = integer_value;
 
example:
 
       const MAX_ENTRIES = 1024;
 
gets translated into
 
       #define MAX_ENTRIES 1024
 
--------------------------------------------
Structures
--------------------------------------------
 
Structures in the RPC definition language are defined the same
as in the C programming language.
 
       struct intpair {
               int a;
               int b;
       };
 
generates the following definition in the header file:
 
       struct intpair {
               int a;
               int b;
       };
       typedef struct intpair intpair;
 
--------------------------------------------
Enumerations
 
As with structures, enumerations in the RPC definition are
the same as in the C programming language.
 
       enum trafficlight {
               RED = 0,
               AMBER = 1,
               GREEN = 2
       };
 
gets translated into:
 
       enum trafficlight {
               RED = 0,
               AMBER = 1,
               GREEN = 2
       };
       typedef enum trafficlight trafficlight;
 
 
--------------------------------------------
Unions
 
Unions in the RPC definition language look very little like
their C counterparts.
 
In C, a union is a list of components that are conceptually
overlaid in a storage area.
 
In the RPC definition language, a union is a specification
of data types based on some criteria.
 
To illustrate, consider a procedure does the following:
 
1. It accepts a character array containing user name as a parameter.
 
2. It figures out if that user is logged onto the system.
   If the user is logged on, the procedure returns a character
   array containing the time the user logged on.  If the user
   is not logged on, the procedure returns no data.  If
   information about the user could not be obtained,
   the procedure returns an integer containing an error code.
 
In this example, the procedure returns one of three data types:
a character array, an integer, or a void (i.e., no value).
 
Unions in the RPC definition language let you convey this
information.
 
They contain a switch that lets applications know which
elements of the union should be used in which cases.
 
The definition of a union follows:
 
       union identifier switch ( declaration ) {
               case_list
       };
 
The identifier is the name of the union.
 
The declaration is a simple declaration as defined
by the C language (an example will follow shortly).
 
Based on the value of the declaration, an element of the
case_list is used.
 
The case_list is a list of statements of the following form:
 
       case value : declaration ;
 
The case_list can also contain an
optional default line of the following form:
 
       default : declaration ;
 
To illustrate, consider the procedure described above
that accepts a user name and returns the time of day that
user logged onto the system.
 
       const MAX_TIME_BUF = 30;
       union time_results switch (int status) {
               case 0:
                       char timeval[MAX_TIME_BUF];
               case 1:
                       void;
               case 2:
                       int reason;
       };
 
This definition describes the three possible data types returned
from this procedure.
 
 
The rpcgen compiler generates the
following C data structure from this definition:
 
       #define MAX_TIME_CHARS 30
       struct time_results {
               int status;
               union {
                       char timeval[MAX_TIME_CHARS];
                       int reason;
               } time_results_u;
       };
       typedef struct time_results time_results;
 
When you implement an RPC program, you must use the
generated structure.  The RPC definition of the union
is for informational purposes, defining the possible
data structures the procedure can return.
 
 
Notes:
 
1. The union component of the structure has the same name as the
   union identifier in the RPC definition, except it has
   a trailing _u.
2. The void declaration is omitted, since it is used only
   to inform users that no information is returned in the specified case.
3. The first element of the structure is the same as
   the union declaration in the RPC definition.
 
When you implement the procedure,
you must be sure that you assign the status element
only the values of 0, 1, or 2.
 
This is because the union definition in the RPC language
only shows those values.
 
You must fill the rest of the structure according to
the RPC specification:
 
- If you place a 0 in the status field, you must
  assign data to the time_results_u.timeval array.
 
- If you assign a 1 to status, you need not fill in
  any part of the union (a 1 in the status field
  says nothing is returned).
 
- If you assign a 2 to status, you must assign a value to
  the time_results_u.reason element.
 
When the application on the client machine receives this structure
from the procedure, it must first check the value of
the status element.  Based on that value, it uses the
corresponding element of the union.
 
 
--------------------------------------------
Type Definitions
--------------------------------------------
 
Type definitions are the same as their C counterparts.
 
       typedef long counter_t;
 
gets transferred directly into the header file.
 
 
--------------------------------------------
Declarations of Arrays
 
The  rpcgen  compiler lets you declare
arrays within structures, unions, and typedefs.
 
Arrays can be of fixed-length or of variable-length.
 
Fixed length arrays are declared the same as their C language
counterparts.  Consider the following:
 
        int proc_hits[100];
 
This declares  proc_hits  to be an array of 100 integers.
 
The  rpcgen  compiler transfers this declaration into
the header file without modification.
 
You can also specify variable length arrays.
 
The maximum size of the array is enclosed in angle braces.  You can
omit the size to indicate that there is no maximum value.
For example, consider the following declaration:
 
        long x_coords<50>;
 
This declares  x_coords  to be an array of
0 to 50 long integers.  Similarly, the following declaration:
 
        long z_coords<>;
 
declares  z_coords  to be an array of long integers.
In this case, the array size is can be any value that can fit
in an unsigned integer.
 
Since the C language does not support variable-length arrays,
the  rpcgen  compiler translates these declarations into
a C data structure.
 
The structure has a length indicator and a
pointer to the array.
For example, the declaration:
 
        typedef long x_coords<50>;
 
gets translated into:
 
        typedef struct {
                u_int x_coords_len;
                long *x_coords_val;
        } x_coords;
 
 
The length indicator is an unsigned integer, and is formed by
appending  _len  to the declaration name.
 
The pointer to the array is formed by appending  _val
to the declaration name.
 
When you implement the remote procedures, you
must use the  x_coords_len and the  x_coords_val  elements of the  x_coords
structure.
 
When populating the structure, you must
set the length of the array in the  x_coords_len  element
and allocate space to store the array in the  x_coords_val
element.
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Declarations of Pointers
 
Pointer declarations in the RPC definition language are the same as in
the C language.  For example, the declaration:
 
        int *nextp;
 
gets transferred without modification into the header file
generated by  rpcgen .
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Strings
 
The RPC definition language lets you declare strings.  Strings
are declared as if they were variable-length arrays.
 
        string first_name<50>;
 
This declares  first_name  to be a string of at most 50
characters.
 
The value in the angle brackets can be empty,
specifying there is no maximum length of the string.
The  rpcgen  compiler translates this into the following
declaration:
 
        char *first_name;
 
The declaration of the string in the `` .x '' file
shows that the string may contain a maximum number of characters.
 
When you implement your procedures, you must allocate space to
hold the string and make sure the string length does not
exceed the maximum value specified in the RPC definition.
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Boolean Values
 
You can declare boolean values in the RPC language.  For example,
the following declares  waiting  as a boolean value:
 
        bool waiting;
 
The  rpcgen  compiler translates this into the following:
 
        bool_t waiting;
 
Since  bool_t  is not a C data type, the RPC library creates
a type definition for you.  You should only place the values
TRUE  or  FALSE  in a variable of this type.
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Void
 
In a  void  declaration, a variable is not named.
The declaration is simple:
 
        void;
 
A declaration of this type can only appear in two places:
 
        1. A union definition.  In a union definition, it is interpreted as
           ``no value.''
 
        2. A program definition.  In a program definition, the argument
           or the result of a procedure can be  void .  A  void
           argument means no argument is needed, and a  void
           result means nothing is returned.
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Opaque Data
 
The RPC definition language also lets you declare opaque data.
Opaque data is untyped and contains an arbitrary sequence
of bytes.  It can be declared with a fixed or a variable length.
For example, consider the following declaration:
 
        opaque extra_bytes[1024];
 
This declares  extra_bytes  to be an arbitrary sequence
of  1024  bytes.
 
The  rpcgen  compiler translates this into a character
array:
 
        char extra_bytes[1024];
 
Variable length opaque data is declared with angle brackets:
 
        opaque more_bytes<1024>;
 
This declares  more_bytes  to be an arbitrary sequence
of  0  to  1024  bytes.  The  rpcgen  compiler
translates this into the following structure:
 
        struct {
                u_int  more_bytes_len;
                char  *more_bytes_val;
        } more_bytes;
 
 
When your RPC application populates this structure, you must
allocate space in  more_bytes.more_bytes_val  to hold the
data.  You must also specify the number of bytes in  more_bytes.more_bytes_len .
 
Note:
 
        If the procedure allocates memory (e.g., to hold
        the elements of a linked list), the data must not
        be deallocated until all processing of the data is complete.
 
        Unfortunately, data is translated into XDR representation
        after  the procedure ends.
        So, you must not deallocate any memory your procedure
        allocates until the  next  invocation of the procedure.
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Let's look at how a remote procedure allocates and frees memory.
 
Suppose you define a remote procedure that returns a linked list of
data.
 
When called, the procedure uses the normal memory allocation
routines ( malloc() , calloc() , etc.) to populate the linked list.
 
When the procedure ends, the lower-level RPC routines translate the
list into XDR representation and send the data to the application on the
client machine.  However, the lower-level RPC routines do not free
this memory.
 
This is a problem because the program supplying the procedure
never exits.  As mentioned earlier, the program supplying
remote procedures runs continually on the server machine waiting
for RPC requests.
 
The next time someone calls a procedure, the previously-allocated
memory still exists.
 
Therefore, a procedure must deallocate previously-allocated
memory when it  begins .  But, since the previously-allocated
data in now in XDR format, the procedure must use XDR routines to
free the data.  We now present these XDR routines.
 
You must use the  xdr_free()
routine to free data your procedure allocates.
 
The  xdr_free()  routine takes a pointer to an XDR
function and a data pointer.
 
It frees the memory associated with the data pointer.
The function passed to  xdr_free()  is the XDR
routine corresponding to the data type.
 
The  rpcgen compiler always names these functions  xdr_any() ,
where any is the data type name.
 
 
Example:
 
        struct link_list {
                int data;
                struct link_list *nextp;
        };
 
 
The  rpcgen  compiler creates a function named
 xdr_link_list()  that translates this data structure
into XDR format.
 
Now, suppose you allocate memory to hold the
list, and place the first memory location of the list in a variable
named  headp .
 
After the XDR routines translate the list into XDR format,
you can free the entire linked list with the following call:
 
        xdr_free(xdr_linked_list, headp);
 
 
As mentioned earlier, the lower-level RPC routines
translate a procedure's results into
XDR representation after the procedure ends.
So, if your results contain allocated memory, you must not free
the memory until the next time an application on a client machine
calls the procedure.
Usually, you free previously-allocated memory at the beginning
of the procedure, and then allocate new data as needed.
